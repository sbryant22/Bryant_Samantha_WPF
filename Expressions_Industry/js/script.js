var width = prompt("What is the width of the area/section that you are wanting to move image to?"); // the width of the section that you want to move your image to and from.

var positionNum = prompt("What is the number of it's position? \nHint: Use the width of the image across area you want and assign the images a number"); // the position number that you want to move the image to
