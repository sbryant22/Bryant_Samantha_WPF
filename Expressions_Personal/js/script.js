songsPurchased[0] = prompt("Please enter the total dollar amount of songs purchased for first week.") // Total dollar amount for songs purchased for that week
songsPurchased[1] = prompt("Please enter the total dollar amount of songs purchased for second week.") // Total dollar amount for songs purchased for that week
